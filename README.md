# Scrabulator
Scrabble solver, work in progress. 
Not meant as a serious project for now, just for testing purposes.

Not useable in the current state, it only renders the interface, and doesn't do anything usefull yet.
But feel free to try it out. 

Suggestions on how to implement the actual word-solving part are welcome
